# It's a Trap!

The last post introduced the *context* of a process in xv6 via the task state
segment. A CPU will use that to perform a *context switch* to a different
process, or to transfer control to some kernel code. The former happens during
scheduling. The latter can happen during a system call (when a user process
jumps up and down asking for the kernel's attention), an exception (when a user
process misbehaves), or a hardware interrupt (e.g., the disk signaling it's done
with an operation, the keyboard signaling a key was pressed, or the timer saying
it's time to switch processes).

We'll look at scheduling later; the last three situations will be referred to
collectively as interrupts, and we'll go over that code now.

## Interrupt Descriptor Table

Imagine if, after every single time some user code carried out a division, the
processor stopped, context switched into the kernel, and asked the kernel to
check if there was a division by zero and handle it if necessary. Or every time
a hardware interrupt happened, the kernel had to start polling all the devices
to figure out which one just yelled. No. Just no. Running kernel code for all
this would be way too slow.

So it's the processor that will have to detect interrupts and decide how to
handle them. But what exactly it should do for an interrupt depends on all kinds
of particulars about that OS, e.g. a disk saying it's done reading from a file
might require updating some file system data or storing the disk data in a
specific buffer or something. That's too much responsibility for the processor.

Okay, so the kernel will set up a bunch of handler functions for every possible
type of interrupt. Then it tells the hardware, "Okay, so if you get a disk
interrupt, here are my instructions to handle that. For timer interrupts, use
these instructions. If a process tries to access an invalid page, do this..."
From then on, the processor can handle the interrupts without further input from
the kernel by looking up the interrupt number in a big table to get the handler
function that the kernel set up, then just run it.

In the x86 architecture, that table is called the *interrupt descriptor table*
or IDT. It has 256 entries (so that's the maximum number of distinct interrupts
we can define); each one specifies a segment descriptor (ugh segmentation again,
you know what that means: opaque code) and an instruction pointer (`%eip`) that
tell the processor where it can find the corresponding interrupt handler
function.

xv6 won't use all 256 entries; it'll mostly stick to 0-31 (software exceptions),
32-63 (hardware interrupts), and 64 (system calls), all defined in
[traps.h](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/traps.h).
But we do have to stick them in the IDT anway, so we're the unlucky fools who
get to write 256 functions' worth of assembly code by hand. Nah, just kidding:
xv6 uses a script in a high-level language to do that for us and spit out the
entries into an assembly file.

Unfortunately for us, that high-level language is Perl. Sigh. Perl is infamous
as a "write-only" language, so I guess instead we're just the unlucky fools who
get to try reading Perl.

## vectors.pl

Okay, I'm not gonna assume you know Perl, and either way I really don't wanna go
over every single line of this file. The syntax is similar enough to C's (except
that somehow they managed to make it even *worse* than C), so you can read it on
your own if you want.

Now, no script will be able to generate 256 completely unique assembly functions
with enough detail to handle each interrupt correctly, so each function in the
script has to be pretty generic. They're all gonna call the same assembly helper
function, which will call a C function where we can more comfortably code up
how to handle each interrupt.

The gist of this Perl script is that it prints a bunch of stuff using a for loop
with 256 iterations. The xv6
[Makefile](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/Makefile)
will run it from the command line with `./vectors.pl > vectors.S` so that the
output gets saved in an assembly file, which will then get assembled together
with all the other kernel code in `OBJS`.

The resulting assembly file will look like this:
```asm
.globl alltraps

.globl vector0
vector0:
    pushl   $0
    pushl   $0
    jmp     alltraps

.globl vector1
vector1:
    pushl   $0
    pushl   $1
    jmp     alltraps

.globl vector2
vector2:
    pushl   $0
    pushl   $2
    jmp     alltraps

# ...
```

Except that a handful of entries (8, 10 through 14, and 17) will skip one line
(I'll explain why below):
```asm
# ...

.globl vector8
vector8:
    pushl   $8
    jmp     alltraps

# ...
```

Then at the end, it defines an array `vectors` with each of those entries above:
```asm
# ...

.data
.globl vectors

vectors:
    .long vector0
    .long vector1
    .long vector2
    # ...
```

Okay, so those are all the handler functions; the `vectors` array holds a
pointer to each one. They're all more or less the same: most of them push zero
onto the stack, then all they push a *trap number* to indicate which interrupt
just happened, and then they jump to a point in the code called `alltraps`;
that's the assembly helper function I mentioned earlier.

A handful of the entries don't push zero on the stack: these are trap numbers
8 (a double fault, which happens when the processor encounters an error while
handling another trap), 10 (an invalid task state segment), 11 (segment
not present), 12 (a stack exception), 13 (a general protection fault), 14 (a
page fault), and 17 (an alignment check). These are special because the
processor will actually push an error code on the stack before calling into the
corresponding handler function in `vectors`. It doesn't push any error codes on
the stack for the others, so we just push 0 ourselves to make them all match up.

## trapasm.S

The processor needs to run the trap handler in kernel mode, which means we have
to save some state for the process that's currently running so we can return to
it later, then set things up to run in kernel mode. The `alltraps` routine does
just that.

Remember how we said the IDT holds segment selectors for `%cs` and `%ss`, plus
and instruction pointer `%eip`? (I know we haven't seen the code to create the
IDT and store the entries of `vectors` in it yet; we'll get to that below.) The
processor will start using those segments (and save the old ones) before running
the trap handler function. Each trap handler function in `vectors` above pushed
an error code (or 0) followed by a trap number. Now we have to push all the
other segment selectors on the stack one at a time, then push all the general-
purpose registers at once with the x86 instruction `pushal`.
```asm
.globl alltraps
alltraps:
    pushl   %ds
    pushl   %es
    pushl   %fs
    pushl   %gs
    pushal

    # ...
```

Cool, all the registers are saved now. So now we'll set up the `%ds` and `%es`
registers for kernel mode (`%cs` and `%ss` were already done by the processor).
```asm
    # ...
    movw    $(SEG_KDATA<<3), %ax
    movw    %ax, %ds
    movw    %ax, %es
    # ...
```

Now we're ready to call the C function `trap()` that's gonna do most of the
work. That function expects a single argument: a pointer to the process's saved
register contents. Well, we just pushed them all on the stack, so we can just
use `%esp` as that pointer.
```asm
    # ...
    pushl   %esp
    call    trap
    # ...
```

That function will return back here when it's done, so let's ignore the return
value by moving the stack pointer just above it (essentially popping it off the
stack).
```asm
    # ...
    addl    $4, %esp
    # ...
```

We'll define a section of code here called `trapret` for the code after `trap()`
returns. We just restore everything back to where it was before, popping stored
registers off the stack in reverse order. We can skip the trap number and error
code; we won't need them anymore. Then we use the `iret` or "interrupt return"
instruction to close out.
```asm
.globl trapret
trapret:
    popal
    popl    %gs
    popl    %fs
    popl    %es
    popl    %ds
    addl    $0x8, %esp  # skip the trap number and error code
    iret
```

## trap.c

Okay, on to the main part of the code! We have to do two things here: stick the
trap handler functions in `vectors` into an IDT, and figure out what to do with
each interrupt type.

At the top, we've got four global variables. The IDT is represented as an array
of `struct gatedesc`s, defined in
[mmu.h](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/mmu.h). It's worth
taking a look at because it uses an obscure C feature (bit fields); we'll do that
in the next section.

Then we declare the `vectors` array of trap handler (with an `extern` keyword,
since it's defined in an assembly file), a global counter `ticks` that tracks
the number of timer interrupts so far (basically a rough timer), and a lock to
use with `ticks`.
```c
struct gatedesc idt[256];
extern uint vectors[];
struct spinlock tickslock;
uint ticks;
// ...
```

### Bit Fields

This section will get *deep* into the weeds, so feel free to skip it if you're
having a nice day and don't want to spoil it by reading about a bunch of C
standards.

So far, we've used bit flags with regular integers by manually doing some bit
arithmetic to set one bit at a time. For example, the flags for page table and
page directory entries are defined as powers of 2 (e.g., `PTE_P` is 0x1, `PTE_W`
is 0x2, `PTE_U` is 0x4, etc.) so that we can set a specific bit using a bitwise-
OR like `pte |= PTE_U` or test whether it's set with a bitwise-AND like
`pte & PTE_P`.

But sometimes that can get annoying and hard to keep track of; wouldn't it be
nice if we could just have variables that represent a single bit? Or two bits,
or any number of bits we want?

The trouble is that most computer architectures don't work with a single bit at
a time; they operate on bytes, words (2 bytes), long/double words (4 bytes), or
quad words (8 bytes), so it would be nontrivial to compile a line of C like
`a = 1` if `a` is a nonstandard size.

In fact, accessing variables that aren't aligned to a standard size (4 bytes on
x86 or 8 bytes on x86_64) is much slower than when they are aligned. Compilers
often optimize code to correct for this by padding `struct`s so that they'll
line up along those standard sizes. For example, one like
```c
struct nopadding {
    int n;
};
```
is probably left the same on x86, but one like this:
```c
struct padding {
    char a;
    int n;
    char b;
};
```
is probably converted by the compiler into this:
```c
struct padding {
    char a;
    char pad0[3];
    int n;
    char b;
    char pad1[3];
};
```

WARNING: We're entering the dark arts of C's unspecified and implementation-
defined behavior here. Note that these are different from *undefined* behavior:
undefined behavior means you did something BAD BAD BAD like dereferencing a null
pointer, freeing a memory region twice, using a variable after freeing it,
accessing an out-of-bounds index in a buffer, or overflowing a signed data type.
Implementation-defined and unspecified behavior aren't as dangerous as undefined
behavior is, but they can cause portability issues.

The C standard is a huge document with a bunch of legalese rules about what
makes C, well, C. People who write C compilers need to know exactly how C code
should behave under all kinds of different circumstances, so the C standard
spells most of it out. But there are some parts it intentionally leaves out.

*Implementation-defined* behavior means the C standard doesn't set any fixed
requirements about how a compiler should handle some behavior or feature; the
developers of a C compiler get to decide how to write that part of the code with
total freedom. One example is the number of bits in a byte; we've been assuming
it's 8, but there are some (dumb) architectures where it's different.

*Unspecified behavior*, on the other hand, means that the C Standard provides
some specific options, and compiler developers have to choose from those options
for *each instance* of the behavior in the code they're compiling (that means,
don't assume it's always gonna be the same, even with the same compiler).

Structure padding is implementation-defined, and there are often implementation-
defined ways to modify it or disable it altogether (i.e., to *pack* the `struct`
instead of *padding* it), usually with stuff like `__attribute__`s or `#pragma`
directives for the preprocessor.

Wait weren't we gonna talk about bit manipulation? Why are we talking about
`struct`s? Well, C does have a workaround to make bit manipulation a little
easier by avoiding that slightly-annoying bit arithmetic you have to do to set
or clear flags in an `int` or `unsigned int`: it's called a *bit field*, and it
takes advantage of `struct` padding.

You can specify the number of bits that a field of a `struct` should occupy by
adding a colon and a size after the field name:
```c
struct bitfield_example {
    unsigned char a : 1;
    unsigned char b : 7;
};
```
This way, you can set the single-bit flag `a` with simple variable assignments
like `var.a = 1`, and the compiler will figure out any necessary magic similar
to structure padding to make that happen. Awesome, right? So why haven't we been
using it all the time instead of all that opaque bit arithmetic with arcane
operators like `<<`, `>>`, `|`, and `&`?

Well, there are some big downsides to bit fields. First, the C standard sets
some strict rules on their use to make sure that compilers can figure out how to
handle them. Bit fields are only allowed inside of structures. You're not
allowed to create arrays of bit fields or pointers to bit fields. Functions
aren't allowed to return a bit field. You're not allowed to get the address of a
bit field with the `&` operator. You can only operate on a single bit field at a
time in any statement; that means you can't set one bit field to equal another,
and you can't compare the values of two bit fields.

Second, they're *extremely* implementation-defined. Each implementation (read:
compiler + architecture combo) determines what data types and sizes are allowed
to be used in bit fields. The data types you *can* use might have different
signedness rules from the usual ones for signed and unsigned types. How they're
laid out, ordered, and padded in memory can differ. In short: the low-level
details are a total black box that you can probably only figure out by reading
*deep* into the compiler's specifications.

Now imagine trying to do something that requires specific protocols like sending
data over a network, and you come across a bit field. Lolwut. Who knows what
you'd have to do. Bit fields make it impossible to port your code.

BUT! Bit arithmetic is annoying, so let's use bit fields anyway!

Okay, so back to `struct gatedesc`. IDT entries have to contain a 16-bit code
segment selector (`%cs`), 16 low bits and 16 high bits for an offset in that
segment, the number of arguments for the handler function, a type, a system/
application flag, a descriptor privilege level (0 for kernel, 3 for user), and a
"present" flag. And x86 is very particular about how it's all laid out, so we
have to set up `struct gatedesc` in the exact right order.
```c
struct gatedesc {
    uint off_15_0 : 16;
    uint cs : 16;
    uint args : 5;
    uint rsv1 : 3;
    uint type : 4;
    uint s : 1;
    uint dpl : 2;
    uint p : 1;
    uint off_31_16 : 16;
};
```

Well, okay, that's it for now, I guess.

### tvinit

This function loads all the assembly trap handler functions in `vectors` into
the IDT. The `SETGATE()` macro in
[mmu.h](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/mmu.h) will organize
each entry correctly. We said before that the IDT needs a code segment selector,
an instruction pointer (from `vectors`), and a privilege level (0 for kernel
mode), so we'll stick those in.
```c
void tvinit(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
        SETGATE(idt[i], 0, SEG_KCODE << 3, vectors[i], 0);
    }
    // ...
}
```

We're basically done now, but there's one last hiccup: user code needs to be
able to generate system calls, but we just set all the privilege levels so only
the kernel and processor can generate traps. So we'll fix the entry for system
calls as a special case.
```c
void tvinit(void)
{
    // ...
    SETGATE(idt[T_SYSCALL], 1, SEG_KCODE << 3, vectors[T_SYSCALL], DPL_USER);
    // ...
}
```

Oh and while we're at it, let's just go ahead and initialize the lock for the
tick counter.
```c
void tvinit(void)
{
    // ...
    initlock(&tickslock, "time");
}
```

### idtinit

The last function stored all the trap vectors in the IDT, so now we need to tell
the processor where to find the IDT. There's a special assembly instruction for
that in x86 called `lidt`.
```c
void idtinit(void)
{
    lidt(idt, sizeof(idt));
}
```

### trap

This last function is the one that gets called by the assembly code in `alltraps`;
it's responsible for figuring out what to do based on the trap number we pushed
on the stack before. Heads up: it's gonna do that by calling a bunch of other
functions, many of which we haven't seen yet. I'll just give a quick summary
when we come across them, and we'll get to them later on.

The only argument is a pointer to a `struct trapframe`. Wait, hang on. Up above
in the assembly code, the argument we pushed on the stack was `%esp`, the stack
pointer, not a pointer to any `struct trapframe`. What's up with that? Did we
pass the wrong kind of argument in?

Let's check out the definition for `struct trapframe`, found in
[x86.h](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/x86.h). It's got a
bunch of fields, starting off with the general purpose registers (those are the
fields from `%edi` to `%eax`). Then it has four segment registers (fields `%gs`
through `%ds`), plus some unused padding bits in between them to round the 16-
bit segment registers up to 32 bits. The next two fields are a trap number and
an error code.

All that should sound familiar. Take another look at
[trapasm.S](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/blob/master/trapasm.S): so
far, those are the exact same things we pushed on the stack! The other fields
are what the processor pushed on the stack before calling the handler function
in the IDT. So basically, we're never gonna construct a `struct trapframe` in C
code; we already constructed it manually in assembly. It just describes
everything that's already on the stack by the time this `trap()` function gets
called. In that sense, the `%esp` we pushed as an argument really *is* a pointer
to a `struct trapframe`. It's a clever way to read values off the stack.

So we said we're gonna check the trap number and decide which kernel function to
call based on that, right? Let's start by checking if the trap number indicates
this is a system call (trap number 64, or `T_SYSCALL`).
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    if (tf->trapno == T_SYSCALL) {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```
Well how should we handle system calls? xv6 will have several, and we don't even
know what they all are yet. So let's procrastinate again and just call some
other function `syscall()` to handle the work of figuring out which system call
to execute. Now, each process has some metadata stored in a `struct proc`; we
can get that by calling the function `myproc()`. We'll cover these later when we
talk about processes proper. For now, we'll store the pointer to the `struct
trapframe` in that process's `struct proc`. Also, processes need to be killed
once they're done, or if they cause an exception; that happens by setting a
`killed` flag in the `struct proc`. So we'll check for that before and after
carrying out the system call and close the process out with `exit()` if it's
due to be killed.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    if (tf->trapno == T_SYSCALL) {
        if (myproc()->killed) {
            exit();
        }
        myproc()->tf = tf;
        syscall();
        if (myproc()->killed) {
            exit();
        }
        return;
    }
    // ...
}
```

Okay, now we have all the other trap numbers to think about. We could do them
with a ton of `if` statements, but that would be a pain; we'll use a `switch`
statement instead. If you haven't seen `switch` statements, they replace big
`if-else` blocks with cases instead. The cases can only be indexed by integers,
and you have to stick a `break` statement at the end or else you'll fall through
to the next case and execute the code found there as well. (To be honest, I
don't see a reason why the system call case wasn't just included in this same
switch statement; if you see a reason for that, let me know.)
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    switch (tf->trapno) {
        // cases go here
    }
    // ...
}
```

First up is the trap number for timer interrupts; the main function of timer
interrupts is to schedule a new process, but that will come further down in this
function. For now, we'll just increment the `ticks` counter then call `wakeup()`,
which checks if any processes went to sleep until the next tick; it'll switch to
running any process it finds. There's one detail to deal with here: the system
may have multiple processors, each with their own timer and interrupts. We want
to use the `ticks` counter as a rough timer, but we don't know whether all the
CPU timers will be synchronized, so we'll only update `ticks` using the first
CPU to avoid those issues.

If you read the last post then you'll be familiar with `lapiceoi()`; if you
didn't (or you forgot), it tells the interrupt controller that we've read and
acknowledged the current interrupt so it can clear it and get ready for more
interrupts.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    switch (tf->trapno) {
        case T_IRQ0 + IRQ_TIMER:
            if (cpuid() == 0) {
                acquire(&tickslock);
                ticks++;
                wakeup(&ticks);
                release(&tickslock);
            }
            lapiceoi();
            break;
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

Later on, we'll see some interrupt handler functions for various devices:
`ideintr()` handles disk interrupts, `kbdintr()` for key presses and releases,
and `uartintr()` for serial port data. We'll direct the corresponding interrupts
to those functions, then acknowledge and clear them with `lapiceoi()`. Also,
devices occasionally generate spurious interrupts due to hardware malfunctions;
we'll either ignore them (if they're coming from the Bochs emulator) or print a
message about it to the console.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    switch (tf->trapno) {
        // ...
        case T_IRQ0 + IRQ_IDE:      // disk interrupt
            ideintr();
            lapiceoi();
            break;
        case T_IRQ0 + IRQ_IDE + 1:  // spurious Bochs disk interrupt
            break;
        case T_IRQ0 + IRQ_KBD:      // keyboard interrupt
            kbdintr();
            lapiceoi();
            break;
        case T_IRQ + 7:             // spurious interrupt-no break, FALL THROUGH
        case T_IRQ + IRQ_SPURIOUS:  // spurious interrupt
            cprintf("cpu%d: spurious interrupt at %x:%x\n",
                    cpuid(), tf->cs, tf->eip);
            lapiceoi();
            break;
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```

Okay, so now we've dealt with system calls and hardware interrupts, so any other
trap must be a software exception. `switch` statements allow a catch-all case
with `default`, so we'll use that to catch the rest of the trap numbers. Now,
this may have come from a kernel error or a misbehaving user process. We can
check with `myproc()`, which returns a null pointer if we were running kernel
code or a pointer to a `struct proc` if we were in user space, or by checking
the current privilege level in the code segment selector. Depending on the
source, we'll print out an appropriate error message and either panic (if in the
kernel) or mark the process so it gets killed soon.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    switch (tf->trapno) {
        // ...
        default:
            if (myproc() == 0 || (tf->cs & 3) == 0) {
                // Kernel code exception
                cprintf("unexpected trap %d from cpu %d eip %x (cr2=0x%x)\n",
                        tf->trapno, cpuid(), tf->eip, rcr2());
                panic("trap");
            }
            // User process exception
            cprintf("pid %d %s: trap %d err %d on cpu %d "
                    "eip 0x%x addr 0x%x--kill proc\n",
                    myproc()->pid, myproc()->name, tf->trapno,
                    tf->err, cpuid(), tf->eip, rcr2());
            myproc()->killed = 1;
    }
    // ...
}
```
The reason we don't kill it immediately is because the process might be executing
some kernel code right now; for example, system calls allow other interrupts and
exceptions to occur while they're being handled. Killing it now might corrupt
whatever it's doing. So instead we just give it the kiss of death for now and
come back to finish the job later.

So next up, we'll check if this trap was generated by a user process that's due
to be killed, and that process is running in ring 3. If so, we finally do
the deed with `exit()`; otherwise if it's running in ring 0, it'll live for now
and get killed the next time it generates a trap instead.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    if (myproc() && myproc()->killed && (tf->cs & 3) == DPL_USER) {
        exit();
    }
    // ...
}
```

Up above, the only thing a timer interrupt did was increment `ticks`. But we
know a really important function of timer interrupts is to force a process to
let go of the CPU and let someone else run. It's time to do that. We'll check if
the process's state is `RUNNING` and the trap was a timer interrupt; if so, we
call `yield()` to let another process get scheduled on this CPU.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    if (myproc() && myproc()->state == RUNNING &&
            tf->trapno == T_IRQ0 + IRQ_TIMER) {
        yield();
    }
    // ...
}
```

Now we have one last check: a process that yielded, then got picked up again
later might have been marked as killed in the meantime, so if it was, we need to
finish it off now. So we do the exact same check as above again, and then we're
done.
```c
void trap(struct trapframe *tf)
{
    // ...
    if (myproc() && myproc()->killed && (tf->cs & 3) == DPL_USER) {
        exit();
    }
}
```
Note that this function will return into `trapret` in the assembly code, which
will then send it back to user mode.
